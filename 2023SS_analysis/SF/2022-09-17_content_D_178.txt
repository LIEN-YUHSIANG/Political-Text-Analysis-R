We will identify all those who brought atrocities from Russia to Ukrainian land – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
Dear Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today, several of our cities should celebrate their days – the day of the city. In particular, Kherson and Berdiansk, which still remain under the control of the occupiers. Yet. No matter what forces the occupiers spent on them, no matter what they said there, our Kherson and our Berdiansk never lost their Ukrainian soul, never lost their faith in Ukraine. And we do not forget them for a single moment and will definitely return.
Just like Kyiv region, Chernihiv region and Sumy region, just like now Kharkiv region, we will liberate other regions and all our land. Wherever there is Ukraine, there will be our flag and nowhere will this atrocity remain – ruscism that repeats what the Nazis did.
They don't make soap out of people, they don't make lampshades out of leather... The scale is not the whole of Europe... But the principle is the same. Camps where people are gathered to kill. Deportations. Burnt cities and villages, completely destroyed – nothing remains alive after ruscism. Missile terror. Mass burials. Executioners. The cruelest torture of people still alive. And the boundless, undisguised hatred with which they justify this war that they started.
Exhumation work continued today in Izium, Kharkiv region, at the site of the mass burial that had been found. Examinations of the bodies are being conducted. New evidence of the torture used against the people buried there has been found. More than ten torture chambers have already been found in the liberated areas of Kharkiv region – in various cities and towns. As the occupiers fled, they also dropped the devices for torture. Even at the ordinary railway station in Kozacha Lopan, a room for torture and tools for electric torture were found. It's just a railway station! Torture was a widespread practice in the occupied territory. That's what the Nazis did. This is what ruscists do. And they will answer in the same way – both on the battlefield and in courtrooms. We will identify all those who tortured, who humiliated, who brought this atrocity from Russia here, to our Ukrainian land.
The situation on the front line has not undergone significant changes over the past day. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, units of our intelligence, SBU, National Guard are gradually, step by step, pushing the occupiers out of our land. But we still need time, we still need effort, we still need to be fully focused on defense and keep all our strength. Many of the Russian soldiers have already realized that they have no chance in Ukraine, that they will be defeated. The most intelligent of the Russian military are surrendered, and we guarantee them compliance with all rights according to the conventions. And we will continue pressing so that all the occupiers understand this. We will beat them harder than before.
I'm thankful to all our soldiers – from commanders to privates! I'm thankful to everyone who helps our defense! I'm thankful to all partners who support the investigation of the crimes of the occupiers and work with us to hold Russia accountable for this war and its consequences! And I thank everyone who helps restore normal life after our heroes liberate our land!
Now the liberated areas of Kharkiv region can finally live – food and medicine are delivered, energy supply is restored, pensions have been brought, we are restoring the operation of transport and railways. The time will come – we will also rebuild everything that was destroyed by the occupiers. And there will be a day when I will be able to say this about each of our cities that are still under occupation. And about Kherson, and about Berdiansk, and about Donetsk, and about Luhansk, and about Mariupol. Of course, about Crimea. Ukraine will return. Ukraine will win!
