All those who help Ukraine restore security, who put pressure on Russia – all are defenders of peace – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
Dear Ukrainians, I wish you health!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
This week is coming to an end – a very fruitful one for Ukraine. And these days we are actively preparing for new events in May and June. We should make this time no less fruitful both in the supply of weapons for our soldiers, and in solutions for Ukraine, in negotiations with our partners.
An important legislative initiative for our society has been prepared. Sanction decisions against the aggressor are being prepared. We are waiting for international meetings of various levels in Kyiv. We are talking to our partners about weapons that will help us do more to restore peace.
This week, many of our partners led in helping Ukraine, helping Ukrainians. From the United States to New Zealand, from the Netherlands and Belgium to Croatia. Northern European countries – Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland. I thank the partners for every decision in support of Ukraine!
We are also working out in great detail new steps to help Ukraine with our other partners, we expect them in the near future – exactly what is needed for our strength on the front lines, for the defense of our sky, for justice against terrorists and for the faster restoration of peace for the entire Ukrainian land. I will definitely inform you about those decisions that can be discussed in public.
It is very important that the world knows about every fact of Russian terror against our people, that the world talks about what the terrorist state is doing, and how we protect life. I am grateful to everyone who helps us by spreading the truth about Russian strikes and shelling, about the brutality of the occupiers, which does not stop for a day!
Endless Russian terror against Nikopol, brutal shelling of the city of Kherson and the region, strikes on the city of Kharkiv and the region, terror against villages in the border areas of Chernihiv region and Sumy region, hell in Donetsk region... Only yesterday, and only in one Russian attack on Kherson region, nine Ukrainians were killed – they were engaged in demining, restoring safety for people. My condolences to the relatives and friends of the deceased.
Security is the main goal for Russia. Both in our country and everywhere in Europe, everywhere in the free world. Destroying security, bringing death and chaos is all a terrorist state does. And everyone who helps Ukraine restore security, everyone who strengthens partnerships between countries in Europe for the sake of security, for the sake of common strength, everyone who puts pressure on the terrorist state – all are defenders of peace. I thank everyone in the world who is with Ukraine, who supports our soldiers!
Glory to all our soldiers now in battle, at combat posts, and on combat missions!
I commend the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade and the 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade for the successful destruction of terrorists in Donetsk region! Thank you, warriors!
The 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, 93rd Mechanized Brigade. Thanks to all of you, guys, for the heroic defense of the positions, and for exemplary resistance! Good job!
