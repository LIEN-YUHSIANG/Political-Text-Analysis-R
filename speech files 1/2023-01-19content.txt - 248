Russia must be held to account for every Ukrainian family killed, for every burned Ukrainian city and village, we have to restore justice - address by the President of Ukraine to the attendees of the Russian War Crimes exhibition in Davos
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
There must be justice.
When there is no justice, all guidelines in life disappear, except for the simplest ones - except for the desire to survive and take revenge.
The revenge for all the evil committed when the enemy destroyed justice.
Ukraine did not start this war. This is an unprovoked and brutal aggression with one aim - to destroy our nation and get rich on everything taken away from our country.
The scale of the Russian crimes on the Ukrainian soil leaves no doubt - this was the plan of the Russian leadership. These are the terms of the invasion they agreed to. All this terror, killings, torture, looting.
Wherever Russian troops entered Ukrainian territory, professional Russian torturers came with them. People are electrocuted, raped, shot in the limbs, starved to death, left without water and sleep...
The burial of tortured people in the occupied territory - in the yards of houses, in the forests, on the roadside - is a companion of the Russian state flag.
This is the way chosen by this state. The way of the terrorist. The way of the torturer. The way of the murderer. The way of the looter.
This is Russia's state choice, and there should come state responsibility.
Russia must be brought to justice for every burned Ukrainian city and village. For every destroyed life. For every Ukrainian family killed by Russian missiles, bombs and mines.
We must bring back justice. We can bring back justice. We must punish evil.
The International Criminal Court has the jurisdiction to prosecute Russian war criminals.
The International Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression of Russia against Ukraine will have the jurisdiction to bring to justice the highest officials of the Russian politics and army who launched this war of aggression.
The special compensation mechanism will have the power to compensate Ukraine and every person affected by Russian aggression for the damage done by Russia.
Compensation should be covered by Russia's assets and all those associated with it.
This terrorist war of Russia against Ukraine should be the last such war.
Never again should any other state step on such a path of terror.
The revenge will not do it. That is why justice is needed.
And I thank everyone who helps us on this path to justice! I thank everyone who helps us to save people and protect our country!
Life will win.
