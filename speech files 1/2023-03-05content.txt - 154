The world is strong enough to punish Russia for the war, and we will provide courage and tools to make it happen - address by the President of Ukraine
Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today marks the end of the first week of the new spring, and it is important to make a few meaningful points about what we have managed to accomplish this week. Accomplish for Ukraine.
A large-scale conference was held with the participation of many of our partners - lawyers from Ukraine, Europe and the world. United for Justice. Step by step, we are moving towards ensuring that the terrorist state is held fully accountable for what it has done to our country and our people.
All Russian murderers, every organizer of this aggression, everyone who in any way sustains the war against our country and terror against our people must be punished. And this is not just a dream of justice. This is work that is already underway. These are agreements that we are already reaching. These are institutions that are already working and will work even harder to restore justice, to punish those responsible for aggression.
The world is strong enough to punish Russia for the war. And we will provide the world enough courage and tools to make the punishment happen. Our confidence in this matter grows stronger with every passing week. And I thank all our partners who help build a network of legal cooperation to ensure that the relevant verdicts are delivered and implemented.
The second important result of this week is the energy sector, the start of preparations for the next heating season. It is already underway. We are working on all scenarios and will do everything to be ready to face any threat next winter.
In six months, our energy sector, government officials, the security and defense sector, and all those involved in the implementation of the relevant tasks must do very specific things. Strengthening the protection of energy facilities, restoring the infrastructure that has been destroyed by Russian strikes over the past six months, and giving our people more opportunities as part of the energy system decentralization project so that they can generate and supply electricity on their private territory, at their private facilities. This is a big undertaking, and it has already begun.
The third result I would like to point out. International relations. Contacts at the highest level with Brazil have been resumed. I spoke with the new President of Switzerland. There were also contacts with the Netherlands, Latvia, Estonia, the European Parliament and other EU institutions. Over the past week, we have reached new agreements with all of them, new movement towards our common goals, and new potential for cooperation.
And, of course, this week is another week when our warriors and everyone who helps defend the state made Ukraine's victory even closer. They repelled assaults, destroyed the occupier, undermined enemy positions and logistics, and protected our borders and cities. I am grateful to all those who are currently in combat! I thank everyone whose life saves the life of Ukraine!
Today I would like to pay special tribute to the bravery, strength, and invincibility of the warriors fighting in Donbas. It is one of the toughest battles. Painful and challenging. The 93rd separate mechanized brigade "Kholodnyi Yar", the 77th separate airmobile brigade, the 56th separate motorized infantry brigade, and the 5th separate assault regiment. Our National Guard and border guards are also there. The 3rd operational brigade of the National Guard. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kramatorsk border guard detachments and consolidated detachments "Dozor", "Volyn", "Chernihiv". Thank you, guys! I thank all the soldiers, guardsmen and border guards who are defending our country in the Bakhmut, Vuhledar, Avdiivka, Siversk, Svatove, Lyman and Zaporizhzhia directions.
I am also grateful to every volunteer who helps our guys keep their resilience! I am thankful to all our medics and nurses who save the lives and health of our fighters!
We are already preparing for the next week, and there will be new results for Ukraine.
We will endure, drive out the invaders, and bring them to justice. Ukraine will emerge victorious!
