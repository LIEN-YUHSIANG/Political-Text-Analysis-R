Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania together will go all the way to restore security of our state and the whole of Europe - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
I wish you health, dear Ukrainians!
Glory to all who fight for Ukraine!
I thank everyone who works for our victory!
I thank everyone who helps us restore security!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today, here in Lviv, important news for Ukraine was announced during the Summit of the Lublin Triangle, our special format with Poland and Lithuania. Poland has decided to provide tanks for Ukraine - I am grateful for this. I thank President Duda, the Government of Poland, all our Polish friends.  
Lithuania provides anti-aircraft systems to our country - the weapons we need to protect ourselves from Iranian drones - to protect our energy sector. 
I thank Gitanas for another demonstration of unwavering and principled support for Ukraine, which began even before February 24 and will continue until our victory.  
Today, I heard this confidence once again from both Andrzej and Gitanas - we will go all the way together to restore security of Ukraine and the whole of Europe, to restore our territorial integrity, to restore peace. Russian aggression must fail - and it will.
Today, we have discussed the issue of our integration into the EU and NATO in a very meaningful way. This year, we must achieve tangible progress in European integration. This concerns, first of all, the start of negotiations on membership. Poland and Lithuania are equally and comprehensively ready to support us, see us fully integrated into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Together with our other partners on the continent and in the Alliance, we have to transform this readiness, this energy into real institutional movement, into real decisions.
Of course, today we also talked about the situation on the battlefield. In particular, that Russian aggression will be depleted only when Russian ambitions have no other alternative except for the defeat. All Russian ambitions - on the front, in politics, in economy, in the legal sphere.
Now the terrorist state and its propagandists are trying to pretend that some part of our city of Soledar - a city that was almost completely destroyed by the occupiers - is allegedly some kind of Russia’s achievement. They will present – and are already presenting – this to their society in such a way as to support mobilization and to give hope to those who support aggression.
But the fighting continues. The Donetsk direction is holding out. And we do everything, without stopping for a single day, to strengthen Ukrainian defense. Our potential is growing. And I thank all our partners who help in this.
Western-type tanks are the work of our entire anti-war coalition and this is a new level of our potential.
Today, in Lviv, I also held a meeting on the security situation in our western regions and on our state border. We take into account all threats, strengthen all elements of the security of our regions.
