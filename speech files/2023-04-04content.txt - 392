Russian aggression proves that only collective preventive security guarantees can be reliable - address by the President of Ukraine
Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
I have just addressed the Parliament of Chile - another country that heard Ukraine, heard what we are striving for. It does not matter what the distance is between our nations. We equally value life and defend the international order. We must deprive rashism of even the hope of support in Latin America.
I also addressed the governors of the US states - this is the first time that I delivered such a special address to the representatives of each state elected by the citizens. I thanked them for their support, emphasized how we, together with America, can not only win the ongoing battle, but also prove that freedom and cooperation always restore normal life after the strikes of aggression.
I also had several international conversations with our partners today.
I thanked Canada and Mr. Prime Minister Trudeau personally for the unwavering support. For another manifestation of it - financial assistance in the amount of 2 billion 400 million Canadian dollars, which our budget has already received. The situation on the battlefield and the security needs of our country were discussed in detail.
In order to drive the enemy out of our land faster and thereby end this war faster, we need to mobilize the world, our partners, all the peoples who do not agree with the chaos that Russian aggression is bringing to the world even more.
I spoke with Ursula von der Leyen, Mrs. President of the European Commission. Our steps in European integration, our joint measures that we are preparing... The new sanctions package of the European Union, which must continue the line of pressure on Russia, pressure to reduce its terrorist potential, its threat.
Today, by the way, a historic event took place for our region, for all of Europe, for the entire Euro-Atlantic community. Finland becomes the 31st member of NATO. The alliance is getting stronger on the eastern flank.
I congratulate all the people of Finland and Mr. President personally on a reliable security guarantee - a collective guarantee.
Russian aggression clearly proves that only collective guarantees, only preventive guarantees can be reliable. That's what we always talked about. We also talked about speed - the speed of security decisions matters. Now we can see how fast the procedures can be.
By the way, this year's NATO Summit in Vilnius deserves to be quite ambitious. The more ambitious the one who protects freedom, the less opportunities for aggression the one who wants evil has.
The day will come when security will be guaranteed for our country as well.
I am constantly in touch with our commanders who are confronting the evil state on the battlefield. A special format of our military meeting was held today. General Syrskyi - regarding Bakhmut, Commander-in-Chief, Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate - regarding the overall military situation. The Ministry of Defense - regarding the supply of ammunition and everything else according to the needs of our defenders. Decisions are already being implemented.
We have also been preparing all day for the international events planned for this week. They are important, brave, ambitious. As it is a rule for Ukraine.
We also keep the internal situation under control, in particular regarding spiritual independence. We also guarantee it. No one will succeed in breaking Ukraine - neither from the outside nor from the inside.
I thank everyone who is fighting for Ukraine! Avdiivka and Bakhmut, Maryinka and Krasnohorivka, every hot direction... I thank you, warriors!
Thank you to everyone who helps Ukraine!
I would like to highlight two decisions today.
The U.S. is providing a $2.6 billion defense support package. Ammunition for HIMARS, for air defense, for artillery is just what we need. Thank you Mr. President Biden, thank you Congress, thank you every American!
And the second decision. Today, the work of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Russian crimes against Ukrainians has been extended. Each such international legal step brings the Rashists closer to inevitable, fair responsibility.
