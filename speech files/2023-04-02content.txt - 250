Rashism must face a total defeat: military, economic, political, legal - address by the President of Ukraine
Ukrainians!
Glory to all who are now fighting for Ukraine!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today, Russian terrorists again struck at Kostiantynivka, Donetsk region. At ordinary residential blocks. Six people were killed by this Russian shelling. Three women, three men. Ordinary people of an ordinary town in Donbas. My condolences to the family and friends of the deceased...
Another 11 people were wounded. Russia used S-300 missiles and the Uragan MLRS against Kostiantynivka.
This morning, Russian terrorists also attacked the Konotop district of the Sumy region. Mortar fire. Two people were killed. My condolences to all relatives, friends, all families...
These are just a few examples of dozens of hits per day. There is only one way to stop Russian terror, to restore security to all our cities and communities - from Sumy region to Donbas, from Kharkiv region to Kherson region, from Kyiv region to Yalta. And this is Ukraine’s military victory. There is no other way and there will be no other way.
The evil state for which it has become the norm to hit residential buildings with "Uragan" like this, to launch S-300 missiles at cities, to shell ordinary villages, people... The evil state must be defeated. In every sense of the word. Rashism must face a total defeat: military, economic, political, legal. The first point is military. And it will face it.
I thank everyone who brings this time closer! I am grateful to our warriors who are fighting near Avdiivka, Maryinka, near Bakhmut... Especially Bakhmut! It's especially hot there today! Near Bilohorivka, near Kreminna and all our other cities, towns and villages of Donbas! The resilience of everyone is the resilience of the whole of Ukraine, helping everyone in a position nearby is helping the whole of Ukraine!
And I would especially like to mention the 77th separate airmobile brigade, the 67th and 92nd separate mechanized brigades, our paratroopers of the “Eightieth”, the 5th separate assault brigade... Thank you, guys!
Marines of the 35th and 36th brigades, gunners of the 55th separate brigade, the 64th and 66th separate gun divisions of the 406th artillery brigade... Thank you, warriors!
Thank you to everyone who protects Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region, the direction of the Dnipropetrovsk region and Kharkiv, Sumy region and Chernihiv region... To everyone who protects our border. Who saves our people from injuries, from pain.
Of course I would like to separately thank everyone who trains our warriors, as it is on powerful training that a successful combat result is based.
Today, April 2, we celebrate the anniversary of the liberation of our Kyiv region from the rashist army. On April 2, the last occupier fled from the territory of the Kyiv region.
There will be a day when we will say: the last occupier has fled or been killed in the Donetsk region, Luhansk region, Kherson region and in our entire south. Crimea will be free and safe again. Ukraine will return all its territories.
Next week will be especially important for our defense, for our advancement towards victory. We are already preparing for scheduled events and decisions.
The key thing now is to cherish our unity, take care of our defenders, help each other and the state.
