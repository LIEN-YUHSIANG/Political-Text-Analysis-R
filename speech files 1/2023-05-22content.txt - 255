Every week we add value for Ukraine from the NATO Summit in Vilnius - address by the President of Ukraine
I wish you health, dear Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
We have already started preparing for this and the coming weeks. We expect new meetings and negotiations, so far to a greater extent – ​​visits to us, to our state. There will be more weapons for our warriors.
Every week we add value for Ukraine from the NATO Summit in Vilnius. We are doing everything to make sure that the decision at the summit is the one that will work for us. We'll see, but still we're working on it.
By the way, today there is an important declaration from the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Things are called what they are: a clear recognition of Russia's crimes against our country as genocide, a clear condemnation of ruscist ideology. This is the right basis for other international organizations as well.
We are preparing for several interim security measures in our neighboring countries, those that support us the most. We will also make new appeals to ensure that the world understands Ukraine and to strengthen our ties with partners.
And we will continue our intensive foreign policy, various non-standard formats, maximizing the world's useful attention to Ukraine and our defense. More and more results for Ukraine – air defense, artillery, armored vehicles, shells, training – all of this is a must.
Today I want to thank all our warriors who are defending the sky. From last night to this morning, they have shot down 25 Shaheds. 25 out of 25. An excellent result. And each such downing means saved lives, saved infrastructure. Thank you!
They also managed to shoot down some of the terrorists' missiles, but unfortunately not all of them. Unfortunately, there were hits. Dnipro and Kharkiv, Odesa and Lviv, Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia - all our cities and communities need to receive a full-fledged air shield. We are working very hard on this together with our partners.
Today, it is worth celebrating the units of the Khortytsia operational and strategic group of troops, which are the most resilient and effective. The 3rd and 5th separate assault brigades, the 80th separate airborne assault brigade, the 93rd separate mechanized brigade "Kholodny Yar", the 214th separate special forces battalion... Thank you, warriors! This is the Bakhmut direction, this is the extraordinary strength of our people.
Glory to all our warriors who are destroying the enemy! 
Glory to all who protect our cities from terrorist attacks! 
Glory to all those who make our victory closer every day!
Thank you to everyone in the world who supports us! Thank you!
