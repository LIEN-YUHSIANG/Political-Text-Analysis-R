We will keep working for the return of all deported Ukrainian children and for the punishment of Russia - address by the President of Ukraine
Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today, there was an important political result in Strasbourg at the session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. A resolution was adopted recognizing that Russia's deportation of Ukrainian children has evidence of genocide. This is the first recognition of this fact at the level of such a high international organization uniting the states of our continent.
Practically speaking, this decision will significantly help our global efforts to bring Russia and its officials, including the head of the terrorist state, to justice for genocide and genocidal policies against Ukraine.
The deportation of Ukrainian children is one of the fully premeditated elements of Russia's attempt to erase the identity of our people, to destroy the very essence of Ukrainians. This is a deliberate crime of genocide committed by Russian officials. This is how it should be qualified both politically and legally.
Today, the First Lady of Ukraine addressed PACE - specifically on the issue of children and families... Our parliamentarians and our diplomats have done a good job. And at all levels - formal and informal, with leaders of states, at the parliamentary, governmental, law enforcement levels, in the legal community and in international and inter-parliamentary organizations - we will keep working for the return of all deported Ukrainian children and for the punishment of Russia. We know for sure the data of almost 20 thousand children who were taken away and dispersed to different regions of the evil state. But it is obvious that this is only a part of much larger criminal actions. There may be many more such children.
Europe and the world have already seen various deportations and attempts to exterminate peoples. It is through the Russian example - the accountability of this state and its officials guilty of genocide - that we must show all other potential sources of the same evil that there will never be impunity. There will be sentences for genocide. Just as for all other crimes committed by Russia against Ukraine and our people.
In Mykolaiv, the debris has been cleared from the site of a rocket attack that took place last night. More than 20 people were wounded, one person was killed... My condolences to the families and friends.
The rockets damaged dozens of ordinary houses and two educational institutions. "Kalibrs" against a school and a college, against residential buildings.
In the evening, another rocket attack was launched at Kostiantynivka, Donetsk region. A school, hospital and residential buildings were damaged. Unfortunately, there are people injured.
Unfortunately, the world's legal machine is taking a long time to gain momentum. But it is gaining momentum. Unfortunately, the world's political pressure on the terrorist state, the sanctions pressure, has not yet reached its full force. But it is reaching...
But our warriors have been doing absolutely everything possible to protect people and humanity since the first day of this battle! And even more than possible.
Avdiivka - the 35th separate marine brigade. Maryinka – our famous "Seventy-ninth"... The entire Donetsk sector – the 55th separate artillery brigade... Thank you, warriors, for your consistent efficiency!
Zaporizhzhia direction - today, as always, we have a lot to thank the warriors of our 44th separate artillery brigade for. Well done!
Today, I conveyed written gratitude to the warriors and the commander of the 95th separate airborne assault brigade who are fighting vigorously near Kreminna, Luhansk region.
I would also like to thank absolutely everyone who is defending Bakhmut and destroying the enemy there on a scale that the occupier deserves.
Glory to all our warriors who are now in combat, at combat posts, on combat missions!
Thank you to everyone in the world who helps us!
Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror!
