It is an honor for me to represent all Ukrainians - President's speech at the annual announcement of the list of the most influential people in Europe Politico 28
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Thanks to everyone who supports us! 
Thank you, Politico, for being always unbiased! 
Слава Україні!

                                            

                                            

                                        
I thank you for this award to the Ukrainian people. And I mean it – it is destined to all Ukrainians. Because leaders can be truly influential only when they represent not only themselves, but the common will, common dream, common goal of their people. 
This is how we live in Ukraine. 
We are as united as possible – and that is why we are that strong. We are focused on protecting our independence – and that is why we are achieving our goals. We have faced the threat of losing everything – and that is why we have found the strength to become number one.
The Ukrainian military, who protect us all on the battlefields, are number one. Maryinka, Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Soledar, Kreminna – please remember these names... that is where freedom is now being fought for. For all of us in Europe. In hard battles and at the cost of many lives.
Ukrainian businessmen who, despite the total war, supply everything necessary for the life of the country, protect jobs and pay taxes, are number one. And I thank all our friends in Europe who help us maintain stability.
Ukrainian doctors, energy workers, sappers, volunteers, drivers and builders, defense workers, teachers, policemen, diplomats... Hundreds of thousands of those who help millions live through this terrible time – they are number one.
And it is an honor for me to represent all these people. All Ukrainians. And guide our common will for our common dream. For the sake of a common goal... For the sake of Ukraine's victory in this war. For the sake of rebuilding Ukraine. For the full accession of Ukraine to the community of European nations – to our European Union.
I believe that Ukrainians will be the most influential next year as well. But – already in peacetime.
