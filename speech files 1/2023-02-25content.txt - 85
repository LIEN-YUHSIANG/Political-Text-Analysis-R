With our courage and weapons, we can restore peace and create a safeguard against any aggressions – Volodymyr Zelenskyy's address to participants of the event of the Federal President of Germany dedicated to solidarity with Ukraine
The people of Germany!
Mr. Federal President!
Mr. Chancellor Olaf!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today is the year since everything has changed. Changed for Ukraine, for Germany, for the whole of Europe and the free world.
What the free world has become accustomed to over decades of peace has turned out to be something that needs to be fought for.
Diplomacy did not work. The existing security architecture in the world did not work. The old European hope that economic ties could keep Russian tank columns from moving did not work.
But there was something that did work. First of all, unity. Unity of Ukraine, Germany, and the entire free world. And determination. Determination to protect the foundations of our lives.
We are fighting on Ukrainian soil for what all of you, dear friends, cannot imagine your lives without. This is basic security. This is freedom and life under the law. This is human dignity and the right of every person and every community to be respected. This is happiness of living in a family and an opportunity to dream of a safe and free future for your children.
Simple things that 1877 Ukrainian cities and villages are now deprived of. The occupier seeks to increase this number and add millions more broken lives to the already broken ones.
You know, in our Mariupol, occupied by Russia, there are almost no undamaged houses left. Russia has done everything to kill this city. Almost half a million people used to live there. 90% of Mariupol is destroyed. Remnants of houses that were destroyed by Russian bombs and missiles, parts of the city that were burned by the occupiers are being demolished by Russia to turn these terrible ruins into concrete crumbs. The crumbs that are going to be used to build roads.
We have to do everything possible and impossible to prevent Russia from turning Ukraine, our neighbors, and the whole of Europe, which Russian revanchism wants to reach, into concrete crumbs.
Can we win? Yes, we are capable of it. United. Determined. And unbreakable. We are able to end the Russian aggression this year already.
Germany has been with us since the first minutes of the Russian invasion. Germany is helping us protect Ukrainians from Russian terror. And Germany will be with us on the day of the victory of freedom, will be with us when we save our cities and villages, now occupied, from Russian captivity.
Now is the time when our bravery and our weapons can restore peace and create a historically important deterrent to any aggression. No one will dare to start aggression against another nation when they know that the free world will protect that nation. No one will ever again encroach on freedom when they know that the free world is determined enough to defend freedom. No one will repeat February 24 last year when they know that there is not a single occupier left on the entire territory of Ukraine.
We can ensure that - together with you! Together with everyone in the world who values life.
I thank you for your support! Thank you for being with us throughout this year!
Thank you, President, thank you, Olaf, for your faith in Ukraine, in our people, and in our shared values of a free, united, and peaceful Europe!
