I urge you to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula and to start the consolidation of the world for the sake of countering ecocide - speech by the President in the Parliament of New Zealand
Dear friends!
Mrs. Prime Minister! 
Mr. Speaker! 
Mr. leader of the opposition! 
Government officials and parliamentarians!
People of New Zealand!
I thank you for your attention!
Nga mihi!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
I am grateful for this opportunity to address you and I would like to offer you leadership.
Leadership in the protection of peace.
This year has shown the world how much you can do when you have enough determination and know what to do.
And let's be honest - at the beginning of this year, no one in the world expected sensations from Ukraine.
When the full-scale invasion of Russia began, I heard only sympathy in the voices of many interlocutors. But when they heard determination in response, everything changed instantly.
Everyone whose heart resonated with the Ukrainian struggle for freedom joined the global coalition for the defense of freedom.
Today, our anti-war coalition already includes more than a hundred states. Those who support the fundamental principles of international law and the UN Charter.
Those who in international institutions - for example in the UN General Assembly - vote for decisions in favor of peace and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
Those who provide our state with armed support and train our military.
Those who imposed sanctions against the terrorist state and constantly raise the price for Russia for aggression and the global crises provoked by it. And those who help us solve these crises.
Those who do everything to hold Russian war criminals to account for what they have committed against Ukraine.
In 293 days of this terrible war, the very developments created opportunities for various countries and leaders to show themselves - to find their function in the protection of what all of us in the world value anyway.
And I am grateful to you, dear friends, for the fact that New Zealand was one of the first to start supporting Ukraine in the struggle for independence and justice.
Having felt the peculiarity of the moral challenge of this war, you changed your own approaches to sanctions policy and applied national sanctions against those involved in inciting aggression.
You helped with finances for security needs, with the supply of ammunition and with the training of the military.
You provided us with humanitarian support and you always help on international platforms.
We in Ukraine appreciate all this very much. I thank you again for this support!
But I would like to offer you something more.
Various dictators and aggressors always do not realize that the strength of the free world is not that someone is big and accumulated missiles, but that everyone knows how to unite and act decisively, sincerely, and that everyone makes their unique contribution to the common cause.
Maybe it is time for your country to make just such a unique contribution.
I am talking now about one of the points of our Peace Formula, which I proposed recently at the G19 summit held in Indonesia.
So, you have probably heard about 10 points that can restore peace to Ukraine and all of Europe, and restore security and stability to the world, which were shattered by Russian strikes. These are very transparent and logical points.
This is radiation and nuclear security. Food security. Energy security. Release of all prisoners of war and return of deportees. Full implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of territorial integrity of Ukraine. Withdrawal of Russian troops from our land and, thanks to this, cessation of hostilities. Restoring justice through the prosecution of war criminals. Countering ecocide. Preventing the escalation of the war and fixing its end.
Each of these points is capable of removing one or another element of Russian aggression.
And therefore, they all guarantee peace.
And I suggested convening a special summit in the coming months. Global Peace Formula Summit, at which the partner states could decide which of the points of the Peace Formula they could help implement.
Similar to how we implement the second point of the Formula - food security. There is a format of cooperation with the UN, with Türkiye, with other partners, and as a result, there are two initiatives that remove from the global food market the deficit that arose due to the criminal Russian blockade of our seaports. We unblocked three Ukrainian seaports. The results of this are obvious.
Our grain export initiative and Grain From Ukraine humanitarian initiative are now working together to solve the problem of global famine. By the way, please inquire about them. Perhaps you will see your role in mitigating the food crisis as well.
But still, first of all, I urge you to pay attention to the eighth point of our Peace Formula. The point on environmental security.
Educated people understand well what war means for the natural environment. Your society is just that - educated.
The destroyed economy and infrastructure can be rebuilt. It takes years.
But you cannot rebuild destroyed nature. Just as you cannot restore destroyed life. 
As of now, 174,000 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory are contaminated with mines and unexploded ordnance. 
The water area of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov is also contaminated with mines and has lost hundreds of thousands of living creatures who died as a result of hostilities and the activity of the Russian navy. 
Dozens of rivers are polluted. Hundreds of coal mines are flooded. Dozens of the most hazardous enterprises, including chemical ones, were destroyed by Russian strikes.
Three million hectares of forests in Ukraine are affected by hostilities.
All this and other manifestations of the Russian ecocidal policy will have direct negative repercussions for millions of people, for our region and neighboring regions.
I am sure that your society feels the fragility of our world. Feels how important it is for all people on the planet to conduct a rational policy in relation to our common home. By the way, just as in relation to our common values, on which the peaceful coexistence of nations is based.
And that is why I suggest that your country, your leaders consider taking into account this environmental point of our Peace Formula. I urge you to show leadership in international institutions, in particular in the UN, and on a bilateral level with other states, so that the world can see this challenge of the Russian war.
So that the world sees that there is no real peace where any child can die from a hidden Russian anti-personnel mine. There is no real peace where the consequences of war in the form of poisoned groundwater can destroy normal life in several countries. There is no real peace where ecocide has taken place, and its consequences have not been overcome.
Perhaps now it seems that there will be no great sensations from such a topic. But until today, the world does not have a common experience of overcoming the destructive impact of war on the natural environment.
We will liberate our land. We will win this war - I am sure of it. We will return freedom and security to all Ukrainians, no matter where they live.
The countries of the world are already taking the lead in implementing such points of our Peace Formula, such as, for example, the point on justice. Yesterday, the Netherlands announced its readiness to host a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine.
And I urge you to support the Ukrainian Peace Formula in your parliament and start the consolidation of the world for the sake of the eighth point of the Formula - for the sake of countering ecocide.
Let Russia be held to account for all manifestations of its aggression.
