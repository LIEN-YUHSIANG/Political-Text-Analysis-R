The defense and protection of our people, the support of warriors is the number one issue at all negotiations - address by the President of Ukraine
Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!
Glory to our warriors!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today, I’m already in Ukraine, in Kyiv, here, on Bankova the whole day. A day of internal meetings and preparations for events planned for the coming weeks.
I held a meeting with Prime Minister Shmyhal. More on current issues. Coordination of state actions, decisions.
A meeting on the security situation, the work of law enforcement agencies.
Our international agenda – the preparation of meetings, negotiations, appeals.
As always, I was in touch with the military: everything related to the hottest areas of the frontline.
It is very important that the content of the visit to Poland, the work of our delegation in Warsaw and in constant communication with Polish partners should be tangible for our front.
Defense and protection of our people, maintenance of our resilience, primarily the resilience of warriors, is the number one issue at all negotiations and meetings.
Exactly defense – weapons for Ukraine, ammunition for Ukraine, new defense systems for Ukraine.
And I thank Poland, I thank our partners for making this visit truly meaningful.
I would like to separately mention the meeting that took place very late yesterday evening, almost at night. Meeting with mayors of Polish cities, rescuer cities for Ukraine and Ukrainians. Rzeszów, Przemyśl, Lublin and Chełm. We met precisely in Chełm - together with Mr. Morawiecki, the Prime Minister of Poland.
I thanked the entire community of rescuer cities, everyone who helped Ukrainians, who really proved in the very first days of a full-scale war that there are no barriers, borders, obstacles between Ukrainian and Polish hearts.
Ukraine knows how to be grateful. Grateful for such solidarity - historical solidarity.
Today, as always, there are some of our divisions worth celebrating.
Paratroopers of the "Eightieth" and fighters of the 57th separate motorized infantry brigade... the 30th separate mechanized brigade... The firmness of your defense, guys, and resilience are inspiring. Powerfully inspiring. Inspiring the world not to lose momentum in supporting Ukraine. Thank you, warriors!
The 35th and 36th separate marine infantry brigades, warriors of the "Zaporizka Sich" 55th separate artillery brigade... As always, well done. As always, they strive for greater results. Thank you!
I’m grateful to the special purpose unit of the 1st main center of the Main Intelligence Directorate who are fighting in Bakhmut. Well done, guys!
Bakhmut and Maryinka, Avdiivka and our entire Donbas, our east, Zaporizhzhia and our Azov region, our Kherson region - I thank everyone who fights for freedom of our country, freedom of our people.
Thank you to everyone who will definitely drive the Russian army out of Ukraine!
