Russia has become a synonym for terror and will become an example of defeat and fair punishment – address of President of Ukraine

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today, I would like to support all those cities and communities of ours facing brutal terrorist attacks by the evil state every day, every night.
Our Kherson region and the city of Kherson, on which the occupier is seeking revenge for its loss. Our Zaporizhzhia. Our cities of Donetsk region and Luhansk region, which Russia wants simply to burn. Our Kharkiv region and the city of Kharkiv. Only since the beginning of this year – in less than two and a half months – over forty enemy missiles have already struck Kharkiv. Nikopol, Marhanets – our Dnipropetrovsk region. Our Sumy region. Our Chernihiv region.
Missiles and artillery, drones and mortars – the evil state uses a variety of weapons. But with one goal. To destroy life and leave nothing human.
Ruins, debris, shell holes in the ground are a self-portrait of Russia, which it paints where normal life reigns without Russia.
Today, Russian shelling took the lives of people in Kherson who simply went to a store to buy groceries. Three Ukrainians died. My condolences to the relatives!
In Zaporizhzhia, a Russian missile hit the city's life support facility. In the border areas, the occupier fired at villages to intimidate people, to drive people away.
But Russia will not be there. It has become a synonym for terror and will be an example of defeat and fair punishment for this terror. The punishment that the Kremlin cannot stop.
Today, I thank our fighters of the Pivnich task force for destroying a terrorists' missile and a Shahed. Fighters of our air defense in Chernihiv region, fighters of the 2nd separate regiment of the National Guard in Sumy region – thank you, guys!
Thanks to all our fighters in the south, who are destroying the warehouses, logistics and positions of the occupiers! Every blown up enemy position is a saved Ukrainian life.
Khortytsia task force... Today, I would like to especially mention the 92nd separate mechanized brigade named after Ivan Sirk, the 80th brigade – our paratroopers, the 5th separate assault brigade... All of them, together with our other soldiers, are defending Bakhmut. Thanks for the strength!
We've got a lot to thank the 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after Hetman Mazepa and the 81st Separate Airmobile Brigade operating in Donbas. Well done, guys!
Thanks to everyone who helps our units! Thank you to everyone who supports our civilians in the frontline and border areas! Thank you to everyone who is convincing the world that it is necessary to show more determination right now! Now, when we are preparing our active actions against the occupier, so that every shot at Ukrainians will be a responsibility of the terrorist state.
And one more. Our new sanctioning step against individuals and legal entities associated with the evil state. The relevant decree has been published. These are more than 280 companies and 120 people who, through gambling business schemes, worked against Ukraine, withdrew funds from our state and financed various Russian schemes.
It took some time to prepare the decision. It has been thoroughly worked out and closes schemes worth tens of billions. And it is not the last such decision.
Ukraine will defend itself everywhere. And by all civilized means.
Glory to everyone who is now fighting for our country! Glory to everyone who helps! In memory of all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror!
