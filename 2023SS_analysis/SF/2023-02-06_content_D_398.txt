Good motivation plus good training equals the ability of our defense forces to regain what belongs to Ukraine - President's address
Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today, I held a regular meeting of the Staff. There are many issues. The key is actions on the frontline. In the Donetsk region and other directions. Particular attention is paid to Bakhmut. To our defense. To the occupier's attempts to surround the city and break the defense there. We are countering them.
I am grateful to every warrior who ensures counteraction with his resilience!
Today, I would like to commend the warriors of the 54th and 93rd separate mechanized brigades, the 15th separate battalion of the 128th mountain assault brigade. Thank you, warriors, for your bravery and steadfastness! For the resilience Ukraine needs so much.
Today at the meeting of the Staff we also discussed the supply of ammunition to our warriors. Artillery is one of the key factors. As always, the Commander-in-Chief and the commanders of the directions delivered reports. The head of intelligence reported on the occupier's current plans.
We are also strengthening our management positions. In a number of regions - especially in the border and frontline regions - we are appointing managers with military experience. Those who can prove themselves in the most effective way in the defense against the current threats. I will inform you about each such decision.
In general, it is worth noting that we will combine the experience gained by our people in defending Ukraine - military experience - with specific managerial work in positions in local and central government.
Today I have heard reports on the situation in Odesa and the region - the one related to the liquidation of the consequences of the energy accident. All services, all officials are working, everyone is involved.
The repair work has already yielded part of the required result, and generators and power equipment are being delivered to the region and the city.
As of now, there are power outages in a large part of the Odesa region. We are doing everything we can to provide electricity to people. Once again, I thank each and every person involved in this work.
Today we have very tragic news from Türkiye and Syria. There was a powerful earthquake there. There are many casualties. Thousands of homes have been destroyed.
My sincere condolences to Mr. President of Türkiye Erdoğan, as well as to those in Syrian society who have lost loved ones, who have lost their homes.
Ukraine immediately responded and offered Türkiye support in the rescue operation.
And one more thing.
The formation of new brigades of the National Guard, police, and border guards - the Offensive Guard - continues. The beginning is powerful. The process will be continued. I thank everyone who has shown interest in the formation of brigades. I thank everyone who has applied!
Good motivation plus good training equals the ability of our defense and security forces to regain what belongs to Ukraine.
Glory to all who fight for Ukraine! Glory to each and every one who works for our country! Glory to everyone who helps!
Today, by the way, we have a very important decision from Norway - the five-year aid package for our country in the amount of NOK 75 billion.
This is an extremely significant contribution to our victory, which we are preparing. A joint victory of all those who really value freedom and value life.
I thank all Norwegians and Mr. Prime Minister personally!
Thank you to all our partners!
Thank you, people of Ukraine!
