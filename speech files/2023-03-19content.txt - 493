Expelling the occupier, clearing our land of traces of the evil state, punishing terrorists are our tasks that we will fulfill - address by the President of Ukraine
Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Another week of our defense against the evil state is coming to an end. Another week when every day, every night, the Russian army shelled Ukrainian cities, villages, and killed our people.
Kamyanske in Zaporizhzhia region, Beryslav in Kherson region, Marhanets in Dnipropetrovsk region, Avdiivka, Kramatorsk and Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region, Kostiantynivka in Sumy region... And dozens and dozens of other Ukrainian towns and villages that have been hit by Russian terrorists this week alone. My condolences to all those who have lost their relatives, their loved ones...
The evil state will be held accountable for every act of terror against Ukrainians. This week has finally brought a truly significant international legal result for Ukraine, for justice. There is a warrant of the International Criminal Court for the arrest of the Russian leader, and this is a turning point.
The moment after which it becomes undeniable that the end of this aggression for Russia will be the full range of its responsibility.
Responsibility for every strike on Ukraine, for every destroyed life, for every deported Ukrainian child... And, of course, for every manifestation of destabilization of the world caused by Russian aggression.
These days, our United24 charity platform has crossed the $300 million mark in donations. From people all over the world - more than a hundred countries, thousands and thousands of donors. Ordinary people, private companies that help buy drones for our military, buy ambulances, rebuild hospitals and infrastructure.
And this is one Ukrainian charity platform. One of the various initiatives that bring the world together.
The world understands what is happening. The world sees how bravely and nobly our people are fighting.
And that is why we manage to mobilize the support of both the leading powers and billions of human hearts around the world. I am grateful to each and every one who believes in Ukraine and who helps us restore security!
I would like to praise our people who are clearing Russian mines and unexploded ordnance left by the occupier. This is a daily painstaking and very dangerous job.
Since the beginning of the full-scale war, our pyrotechnics and explosives specialists have already inspected more than 100 thousand hectares of territory.
Over 400 thousand enemy shells have been neutralized. More than 200 thousand explosive items have already been removed.
I am thankful to everyone involved in this!
And I would like to commend the pyrotechnics of the State Emergency Service. Oleksandr Dvoretsky from Ternopil and Roman Shutylo from Luhansk region, who have been working in Kherson region for almost six months in a row, returning security to Ukrainians. Thank you!
I am grateful to Roman Radavchuk from Kyiv region, who works in Mykolaiv region, demining energy facilities. I thank Vasyl Popovych from Chernivtsi for demining in Donetsk region. I thank Yevhen Zakharov from Kyiv for demining in Kharkiv region.
I wish a speedy recovery to Yevhen Melnyk, Andriy Makoviychuk, Vitaliy Rudenko, Volodymyr Klyapchuk, Vladyslav Bak... These are pyrotechnics of the State Emergency Service who were clearing the territory of Kherson region and were injured.
I am grateful to the explosives specialists of our police. Andriy Ilkiv and Taras Sal, who worked in the de-occupied areas of Kyiv and Kharkiv regions.
I am grateful to Anatoliy Chechelnytsky for demining in Mykolaiv region.
I am grateful to Ihor Zabolotnyi, Tetiana Kuzubova, Valeriy Onul, Maryna Ostrovska and Vyacheslav Iarovyi for demining in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Kherson and Kyiv regions.
I am grateful to the sappers of the National Guard of Ukraine and our Armed Forces!
Expelling the occupier, clearing our land of all traces of the evil state, and punishing terrorists are our tasks. Tasks that we will fulfill.
We Ukrainians are united. And the world is united.
Glory to all those who are fighting for Ukraine! Those who are fighting in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, those who are defending our south, those who are holding our border. Glory to all who are preparing the de-occupation of our lands!
Eternal memory to all those whose lives were taken by Russian terror, Russian bombs, and Russian mines.
