Thank you all so much!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
That is how I began my address to the European Council on March 24, three months ago, when I urged you to support us.
And that’s quite a path we have come in these three months! All of us together: Ukraine, your states and the European Union as a whole.
This path is not politics. I believe this is what will always be the starting point of Europe's new history. Europe without division. Europe without "gray" zones. Europe that is truly united and that knows how to defend itself, its values, its future.
Today you have adopted one of the most important decisions for Ukraine in all 30 years of independence of our state.
However, I believe this decision is not only for Ukraine. This is the biggest step towards strengthening Europe that could be taken right now, in our time and in such difficult conditions, when the Russian war is testing our ability to preserve freedom and unity.
On the fifth day of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, we applied to join the European Union. We provided extremely fast and high-quality answers to the questionnaire we received from the European Commission.
And here is the desired result today. Today, I would like to reaffirm that Ukraine is capable of becoming a full-fledged member of the European Union.
Then, three months ago, I addressed each country of the European Union and indicated at what stage we were, as I thought, in our relations. And today I would like to tell each and every one of you personally what our people feel, and in the same order as it was then.

stands for us. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you, Viktor, together we are capable of much more than alone!
Roberta Metsola! We are grateful to you personally and grateful to the European Parliament! You were the first to support Ukraine's candidate status the day after our application.
, dear Charles, 
, dear Ursula, I am grateful to you both for the leadership that has led us all to this day. I am grateful for the sincere help, for the faith in Ukraine, in Ukrainians, in all of us.
I have always said that we, Ukrainians, believe in the European Union. Although we remained formally outside the European Union, our country probably had the largest number of flags of a united Europe.
They were in the hands of our people during the revolutions. They have been in the hands of our people in the trenches since 2014. I believe that the flag of the European Union will be in every Ukrainian city that we have yet to liberate from the occupation of the Russian Federation.
Ukrainian and European flags will also be together when we will be rebuilding our state after this war together.
And today in the framework of our joint meeting – the summit of all European leaders, I would like to express special gratitude to our heroes - each and everyone who defends the independence of Ukraine with weapons in their hands, defends the freedom of Europe.
Thank you! Thank you for making possible a new history of Ukraine, a new history of Europe - even stronger, even freer.
