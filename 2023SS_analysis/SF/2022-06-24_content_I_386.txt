Share the feeling of freedom, spread the truth about Russia’s war, help Ukrainians – address by the President of Ukraine to the Glastonbury Festival participants 
Greetings, Glastonbury!
Thank you. 
Слава Україні!

                                            

                                            

                                        
The festival resumes this year after a two-year break. The pandemic has put on hold lives of millions of people around the world, but has not broken.
We, in Ukraine, would also like to live the life as we used to and enjoy freedom and this wonderful summer. But we cannot do that because the most terrible has happened - Russia has stolen our peace.
But! We will not let Russia’s war break us. And we want to stop the war before it ruins people's lives in other countries of Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America – they are all under threat now.
That is why I turn to you for support!
Glastonbury is the greatest concentration of freedom these days. And I ask you to share this feeling with everyone whose freedom is under attack.
Spread the truth about Russia’s war! Help Ukrainians who are forced to flee their homes because of this war. Find our United24 charity platform. And put pressure on all the politicians you know to help restore peace in Ukraine.
Time is priceless, and every day is measured in human lives. The more people join us in defending freedom and truth, the sooner Russia’s war against Ukraine will end. Prove that freedom always wins!
