When a terrorist destabilizes everyone's lives, stopping terror is a joint task - address by the President of Ukraine
Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!
Glory to everyone who defends Ukraine!
Gratitude to everyone who helps our state hold out against Russian terror!
Eternal memory to everyone whose life was taken by terrorists!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
A report on the day.
The main result - 70 Russian missiles were launched, most of them were shot down. Kalibr, Kh-101, etc.
I am grateful to all our warriors of the air commands "East", "South" and "Center". Well done!
I am also grateful to our partners for the air defense systems we are currently using. Every downed Russian missile is concrete proof that terror can be defeated.
But, unfortunately, we still cannot ensure complete security to our sky - there were several hits.
Unfortunately, there are victims. As of this time, there are four people killed by Russian strikes today. My condolences to families and friends.
Energy workers immediately started restoration. Maximum efforts are in the central regions of Ukraine, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions. In many regions we had to switch to emergency shutdowns to stabilize the system. From Zakarpattia to Kyiv region, from Kirovohrad region to Sumy and Kharkiv regions. As of this evening, the biggest number of shutdowns is in Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Khmelnytskyi and Cherkasy regions. But we will do everything to restore stability.
Russian terror again affects neighboring states. There are interruptions with electricity supply in Moldova again. And this once again proves that Russia's ability to carry out such massive terrorist attacks is a threat not only to Ukraine, but also to our entire region. At least.
When one terrorist destabilizes everyone's lives, stopping terror is a joint task.
Tonight I will talk about this in my address to the expert community of the American Institute for the Study of War and to all our friends in the United States.
By the way, with today’s missile attack Russia marked the anniversary of the Budapest Memorandum. The fate of this document gives answers to many current questions about Russia. Simply signing something with these terrorists will not bring peace. They will certainly break any agreements reached with them. Giving up any element of someone else’s security to Russia means new war.
Therefore a principled continuation of the existing policy of conscientious states of the world is necessary: it is only the dismantling of Russian terrorist capacities, liberation of all our territories and holding the murderers to account that will bring peace. I believe we will come to this.
Another result of today is a new declaration of support for Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic course. This is the third such declaration. Today it was signed with Montenegro. After the Czech Republic and Belgium.
We will complete this path step by step - we will persuade the Euro-Atlantic majority in favor of Ukraine. And not just in words, but in decisions. In decisions to support our accession to the collective security system.
And one more thing
Finally, a special award for extraordinary people appeared in Ukraine - for Ukrainian volunteers. "Gold Heart". Today, greeting the volunteer community, I named the first 50 teams and individuals who will receive this new award shortly. But this is far from a complete list of those who deserve it.
The state should know how to be grateful and express gratitude. And it will.
