Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today is International Women's Day, a day of struggle for women's rights.
Every year on this day, I express my gratitude.
I thank my mom, I call her. I express my gratitude for the fact that there has always been respect in our family.
I thank my wife. For being together, for loving each other, and for having such beautiful children.
I thank the women who work with me. It is very important that we are equals as colleagues.
And today we can say different words, pay attention to different aspects of this day.
Everyone has an opinion on how and what to do on this day, March 8. And this is our strength. This is freedom.
We are equal, we are free, we are in a strong Ukraine.
I think it is important to express gratitude today. To all the women who work, teach, study, rescue, heal, fight - fight for Ukraine. To remember and thank all the women who gave their lives for our country.
To thank mothers. To remember that as long as your mom is alive, you can feel like a child. To thank your loved ones for their respect and strength.
Together we are strong. Together we are invincible. Together we are free. And together we will definitely win.
We will.
