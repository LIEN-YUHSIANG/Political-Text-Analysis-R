Every day we lose people whom we will always remember and regret they're not coming back – address of President of Ukraine

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today was a long day – operational decisions, international communication, and various issues that deserve attention and response.
But now I want to say only one thing.
I don't want to talk for a long time.
Today, we said farewell to those whose lives were taken by the helicopter crash in Brovary.
Denys Monastyrsky, his colleagues from the ministry: Yevhen Yenin, Yuriy Lubkovych, Tetiana Shutiak, Mykhailo Pavlushko, Mykola Anatsky, Andriy Marynchenko... Guys from the crew: Oleksandr Vasylenko, Kostiantyn Kovalenko, Ivan Kasianov... A woman and a child who were just going to kindergarten in the morning... Mother Olena Ponomarenko and her daughter Milana Ponomarenko...
My condolences to all relatives and friends... It hurts to think about it, it hurts to say about it.
Denys was a professional, genuine person, exactly what the Minister of Internal Affairs should be. Every day we lose people, whom we will always remember and regret that they're not coming back.
You cannot bring back Ukrainians, patriots, and people who are professional and simply loyal to themselves and the state.
I wish we could all feel that today. Feel how many lives, how many bright people have been taken by wartime. I would like us all to honor their memory today…
Great tribute to all those, whose lives were taken away by the war! Great tribute to all those, who gave their lives for Ukraine!
We are doing everything to remove this war from our land.
