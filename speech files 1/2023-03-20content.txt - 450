Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!
I am grateful to each and every one who is now in combat!
Glory to all who defend the independence of our country!
Thank you to everyone who helps!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
We have several important decisions today, primarily defense decisions.
Our European partners have agreed on a joint plan to accelerate the supply of shells for our artillery.
This decision is worth 2 billion euros. It provides for both emergency supply and production of ammunition.
This is a strategic step. It gives us confidence in our unity, in the immutability of the movement towards victory over the terrorist state.
I am thankful to all our partners in Europe! To everyone who is truly interested in making Europe strong and free.
A new defense package from the United States was also announced today. The amount is 350 million dollars.
These are rockets for HIMARS, artillery shells and other ammunition - everything we really need to support our warriors.
I am grateful to President Biden, Congress, and all Americans!
I held three international conversations today.
With Austrian Chancellor Nehammer, we discussed our bilateral cooperation - humanitarian and political issues. We also discussed our joint opportunities to restore justice violated by Russian aggression.
I thanked Austria for joining the group that is preparing the establishment of a Special Tribunal on Russia's aggression against our country.
I also thanked Ireland - Mr. Prime Minister - for his country's accession to this group. The circle of partners willing to work together to punish Russia for its aggression is inevitably expanding, making the prospect of punishment more and more realistic.
It is not enough to bring to justice those responsible for crimes caused by aggression.
It is also necessary to punish - quite fairly and legally - the original crime that gave rise to all the other crimes of this war.
This is exactly what the Special Tribunal will provide. Every day we bring its creation closer.
By the way, today this issue, as well as our joint work with the International Criminal Court, was discussed in London during the conference of European ministers of justice.
I addressed the participants of the Conference and urged them to support all elements of international efforts to ensure that the aggressor is surely punished.
It is very important that we discussed with both the Austrian Chancellor and the Irish Prime Minister the possibilities of medical treatment and rehabilitation of our people who were wounded by Russian weapons.
With Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, we focused on defense issues, on quite practical steps that will help implement our Peace Formula.
I informed him about the situation on the frontline, our main needs and capabilities.
I thank Mr. Prime Minister for his full understanding of the situation and for his unwavering belief that the power of European values is stronger than Russia's hatred of European freedom.
Today, as always, I would like to commend our warriors. All those who are fighting for our country.
The 56th and 57th separate motorized infantry brigades - thank you guys! Thank you for your strength and resilience in the defense of Bakhmut!
The warriors of the 72nd Black Zaporizhian separate mechanized brigade, paratroopers of the 79th brigade, marines of the 35th and 36th separate brigades, the 74th separate reconnaissance battalion, our artillerymen of the 55th Zaporizhzhia Sich brigade - I am glad to be able to steadily thank you for the results, for your strength, for your resilience in Donetsk region!
Kherson direction... The 406th separate artillery brigade and the 131st separate reconnaissance battalion - well done, guys! Always accurate, always strong!
