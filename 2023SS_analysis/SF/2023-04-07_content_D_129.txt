The world should know: respect and order will return to international relations only when the Ukrainian flag returns to Crimea – address of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy

                                            

                                            

                                        
Today was a busy day.
First, the meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The main focus is on the battles for Avdiyivka and Bakhmut, for Luhansk region, for each of those directions where the enemy is trying to break the defense of the whole of Ukraine.
And I thank every soldier, sergeant, officer, and general who stands against it. Those who gain stability for Ukraine – for the whole state – right there, in the battles at the hottest spots of the frontline.
The task force commanders, the Commander-in-Chief, and intelligence reported at the meeting of the Staff.
Separately – training of new brigades. Supply of ammunition and weapons to the troops.
Second, the NSDC staff, together with the Government, together with ministries, is preparing a new potent list of sanctions against persons who work for aggression. They will be blocked.
Third, I held a long meeting devoted to energy, both strategic issues – the development and protection of our energy system under any conditions, and current issues – the energy supply of our people and Ukrainian business.
Fourth, we are adding a new tradition of respect to the official life of our state.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslims in Ukraine and the Muslim community of the world – different countries, different nations – observe a strict fast during the holy month of Ramadan. When the sun sets, the Iftar dinner takes place.
In Ukraine, it is respected everywhere, and even at the frontline, even in combat conditions. The Crimean Tatar people respect Ramadan... Respect should always be mutual. Therefore, starting this year, such a special event of respect will be held annually in Ukraine with the participation of the Head of State. And today for the first time – in the Crimean Tatar cultural center.
The world should know: respect and order will return to international relations only when the Ukrainian flag returns to Crimea, when there is freedom there – just like everywhere else in Ukraine.
I had the honor to reward our soldiers, Ukrainian Muslims, who are fighting together with everyone in the defense forces of Ukraine. I had the honor of sharing Iftar with our soldiers, representatives of the Mejlis, and the entire Ukrainian Muslim community.
And I want to thank everyone in the big world Muslim community who supports our principle – the principle that no one is allowed to destroy the peace with aggression, which is given to everyone on Earth equally by God, who values every nation as much as we do in Ukraine.
And fifth. Today, I signed several decrees on awarding state awards to our soldiers. 771 fighters.
Soldiers of mechanized brigades, assault brigades, ground defense brigades, our anti-aircraft fighters, tactical aviation, artillery, reconnaissance battalions, engineering brigades, tankers. During the full-scale war, totally over 43,500 of our defenders were awarded state awards.
I thank everyone who defends the state! Glory to all who are now fighting for Ukraine!
And I congratulate everyone who celebrates the Annunciation today! We pray for the victory of our soldiers and the salvation of all our people from the evil of occupation!
