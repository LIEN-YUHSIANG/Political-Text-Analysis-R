This year the world saw how important the contribution of Ukrainians to global food security is – address by the President of Ukraine
Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!
Glory to all who fight for Ukraine!
Glory to everyone who works and helps!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
This day is coming to an end - already the 270th day of the full-scale war. I will report briefly.
The first topic is the frontline. The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there are fewer attacks today due to the deterioration of the weather, the number of Russian shelling occasions remains, unfortunately, extremely high.
Luhansk region - little by little we are moving forward with battles. As of now, there have been almost 400 shelling occasions in the east since the beginning of the day. Thank you to each and everyone who holds positions and helps our defense forces.
South - we are holding the line, consistently and very calculatedly destroying the potential of the occupiers.
The second topic is energy. Restoration of networks and technical supply capabilities, demining of power transmission lines, repairs - everything goes on round the clock.
We managed to alleviate the situation in some regions where there were a lot of real problems yesterday. This evening there are stabilization shutdowns in 15 regions and in Kyiv as well. The largest are Vinnytsia, Sumy, Poltava, Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv regions and the capital. We are doing everything possible and impossible to return normal life to Odesa, Kharkiv and all our cities and communities.
And I thank all energy workers, utility workers, regional administrations - everyone who works for the sake of Ukrainians.
The third topic is foreign policy. Today I addressed the participants of the summit of the  International Organization of La Francophonie. These are more than 50 participating countries, and more than 20 observer countries. Africa, Asia, America, Europe - everywhere they hear Ukraine, everywhere they know our proposals on how to restore peace to Ukraine and how to restore stability to the world.
I will say right away that the Ukrainian peace formula is perceived extremely positively in the world. It is quite constructive and realistic - in contrast to the empty and mendacious Russian rhetoric about their alleged readiness for some kind of negotiations.
We will do everything to make the world accept the Ukrainian peace formula.
There will be several important international addresses in the upcoming week. And we are already preparing.
And one more thing.
Traditionally, the Day of Agricultural Workers is celebrated in Ukraine on the third Sunday of November. Was there ever an international context to this day? This year it’s definitely there.
This year, many people in the world saw how important the contribution of Ukrainians to global food security is. The lives of millions of people in different countries directly depend on our agricultural sector.
I thank all our people who work on the ground, who provide Ukraine and the world with the essentials. Thanks to you and your work, we can find support for our state in those countries with which we do not yet have traditional relations. But we will have them, trust me.
