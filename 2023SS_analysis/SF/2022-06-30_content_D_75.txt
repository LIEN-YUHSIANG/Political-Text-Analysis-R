Zmiinyi Island is a strategic point, its liberation significantly changes the situation in the Black Sea - address by the President of Ukraine
Ukrainians! 
All our defenders!
Eternal glory to all who defend the state!
Eternal memory to everyone who gave their lives for our freedom, the freedom of Ukraine!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Undoubtedly, the main word today is Zmiinyi. Apparently, there was just as much talk about Zmiinyi only on the day when the Russian ship arrived there. Then the ship left - forever, and now the island is free again. I am grateful to the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, the fighters of "Alpha", I am grateful to our gunners, pilots of the army aviation and Air Force, the command of "Oleksandriya".
Zmiinyi Island is a strategic point, and it significantly changes the situation in the Black Sea. It does not guarantee safety yet, it does not yet guarantee that the enemy will not return. But it already limits the actions of the occupiers significantly. Step by step, we will drive them out of our sea, our land, and our sky.
The situation in Donbas remains the toughest, extremely difficult. The fire superiority of the occupiers is still extremely tangible - they have already taken everything from their reserves to hit us: the Luhansk region, the Donetsk region. I am grateful to everyone who defends our positions in such conditions. This is true heroism.
The United States announced today a new package of support for Ukraine, primarily concerning defense. I am grateful to President Biden for this assistance. Soon it will get to the frontline to work for Ukraine, for the defense of freedom.
Talked about defense support with the Federal President of Germany. Thanked him for the help that had already been provided. Once again I outlined our priorities - the types of weapons we need. President Steinmeier expressed his condolences over the inhumane attack on Kremenchuk and our other cities.
Today, another significant step in our rapprochement with the European Union took place - Ukraine launched a significant export of electricity to the territory of the EU, to Romania. And this is only the first stage. We are preparing to increase supply.
At the expense of Ukrainian electricity, a significant part of the Russian gas consumed by Europeans can be replaced. That is, it is not just a question of export revenue for us, it is a question of security for the whole of Europe.
I would like to remind you that our country joined the common energy system of the EU already after the start of the war. Ukraine is doing things that seemed impossible.
France's Presidency of the Council of the EU ends today. The historical period when we received the candidacy. Europe has become stronger over this time. The Presidency of the Czech Republic begins, and I am grateful to our Czech partners for the fact that they have identified the reconstruction of Ukraine as one of the priorities of their Presidency. It is really important to start reconstruction as soon as possible on the territory that has already been liberated.
And our priority - and this will be a task for all representatives of the state - everything should be done as soon as possible to prepare the start of membership negotiations. Government officials, deputies, diplomats - everyone must work on this 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. By the way, tomorrow there will be news on this topic. Ukraine’s European integration cannot be stopped.
