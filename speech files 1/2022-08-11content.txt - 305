Only the complete withdrawal of Russians from the Zaporizhzhia NPP guarantees the restoration of nuclear safety for the whole of Europe - address by the President of Ukraine
Ukrainians!
Eternal glory to all our warriors!
Glory to each and every one who defends Donbas, the Kharkiv region, the south, the center and our entire state!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
Brief summaries of the day.
I took part in the donor conference in Copenhagen. These are 26 partner states of Ukraine: European countries, the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand. They established another format - as a continuation of the well-known meetings at the Ramstein Air Base. This format is about long-term support, including weapons, ammunition, military training, demining, recovery of the liberated territory.
We already have the first results of the conference. Immediately after the opening of the meeting, Denmark announced a new support package for Ukraine in the amount of 110 million euros. In general, the conference collected 1.5 billion euros in just one day, which will be spent, in particular, on the production of vital ammunition. By the way, this is a significant plus to those credit guarantees for 4 billion dollars that were previously provided by the United States to strengthen our defense cooperation with partners on the supplies for the Ukrainian army.
I am thankful to everyone who supported Ukraine today in Copenhagen, and I believe that this format of cooperation will accelerate our joint victory.
In my address to the conference participants, I emphasized that everyone needs to act much faster and tougher. And especially after Russia resorted to unconcealed nuclear blackmail. What is happening now around the Zaporizhzhia NPP is one of the biggest crimes of the terrorist state. Today, another shelling by Russia was recorded on the territory of the plant, in the immediate vicinity of the NPP facilities.
Russia has once again gone through another floor in the world history of terrorism. No one else has used a nuclear plant so obviously to threaten the whole world and to put forward some conditions. And absolutely everyone in the world should react immediately to expel the occupiers from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. This is a global interest, not just a Ukrainian need. We emphasize this at all levels - from the UN Security Council to contacts between states. Only the complete withdrawal of Russians from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP and the restoration of Ukraine's full control over the situation around the plant will guarantee the restoration of nuclear safety for all of Europe.
Today I would like to point out an important thing for all representatives of the state and local authorities, the military sphere and other persons who comment on the events at the front, the defense plan of the command, the preparation of specific operations, etc. The general rule is simple: war is definitely not the time for vanity and loud statements. The less concrete details you give about our defense plans, the better it will be for the implementation of those defense plans.
If you want to leave the big headlines, that's one thing. Frankly irresponsible. If you want victory for Ukraine, then that is another thing, and you should feel your responsibility for every word you say about our state’s preparation for defense or counteroffensive.
Another conversation took place in the permanent format "Yermak, Sullivan, Zaluzhny, Milley". The topic of the conversation is clear. The content is positive. And the details, I think, are superfluous.
I met today with chef Jose Andres, the founder of World Central Kitchen international humanitarian organization. For more than ten years, he has been feeding people in countries that have become victims of war or natural disasters. A successful restaurateur, working in America, one of the most famous and influential people in the world.
From the first days of Russia's full-scale war against our country, his organization started working on the border with Poland - for migrants. Subsequently, it started activities in many cities of Ukraine - already 5 thousand people work there. More than 130 million meals have been cooked for our citizens.
We agreed with Mr. Andres on the expansion of such a humanitarian mission, in particular to areas that are gradually being liberated from Russian occupation.
And today I also want to thank all Ukrainians and citizens of the friendly states who help meet the humanitarian needs created by this war. Those who help displaced people with housing and jobs. Those who treat and rehabilitate those wounded by Russian shelling. Those who deliver medicine, food and means of communication to the frontline areas. Those who support lonely people and orphans of this war. And those who help restore everything that was destroyed by Russian terrorists.
This is a multi-thousand-strong humanitarian army of Ukraine and the entire free world, to which Russia cannot and will not be able to oppose anything. I thank you!
Tomorrow will be a busy day - there will be many international and domestic events tomorrow. We are already preparing for them. We do everything to ensure that our defenders have reliable support at the political, diplomatic, economic, humanitarian and all other levels.
