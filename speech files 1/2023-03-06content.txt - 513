The occupier is killing for the very fact that we are Ukrainians, for the mere word about Ukraine - address by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
Good health to you, fellow Ukrainians!
Glory to Ukraine!

                                            

                                            

                                        
I started the day with a meeting of the Staff. A detailed meeting.
We reviewed the situation in the operational directions, at each key point of hostilities. The Commander-in-Chief, commanders, and intelligence delivered reports. There was a special report on the situation in Bakhmut, around the city, and more than an hour-long conversation. In fact, it was the topic of Bakhmut that became the main topic for this meeting.
I want to be honest about such topics.
Unfortunately, there are many different disinformation messages. From those who donâ€™t even have access to absolutely confidential discussions about defense, but claim something about some alleged decisions on defense issues.
Society must understand the meaning of our defense operations, the true meaning.
Today at the Staff meeting, I directly asked both Khortytsia commander, General Syrskyi, and Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny about their view of the further defense operation in the Bakhmut sector.
Either withdrawal or continuation of defense and reinforcement of the city.
Both generals replied: do not withdraw and reinforce. And this opinion was unanimously backed by the Staff.
There were no other opinions.
I told the Commander-in-Chief to find the appropriate forces to help the guys in Bakhmut.
There is no part of Ukraine about which one can say that it can be abandoned. There is no Ukrainian trench in which the resilience and heroism of our warriors would be disregarded.
The occupier kills for the very fact that we are Ukrainians. For the mere word about Ukraine. For our dream of Ukraine. For our lives - the lives of Ukrainians.
And we are destroying the occupier everywhere - wherever it yields results for Ukraine.
Bakhmut has yielded and is yielding one of the greatest results during this war, during the entire battle for Donbas.
And I thank every soldier who is fighting in this most difficult area. Who is fighting for all parts of our country, in all directions.
We are defending and will continue to defend every part of Ukraine. When the time comes, we will liberate every city and village of our country. And we will hold the occupier accountable for every shot against Ukraine, for every meanness against Ukrainians.
If we can do it legally, then we will do it legally. If we can do it with weapons, then we will do it with weapons.
Due to our unity, due to our determination, due to the fact that we value the whole of Ukraine and every Ukrainian, we know exactly the outcome of this war.
We have known it since the first days of the war.
In Ukraine, we will always hear: "Glory to Ukraine!". And millions will always respond: "Glory to the Heroes!". It will always be like that.
Ukraine will not forget the feat of each and every one whose lives gave freedom to Ukraine forever.
Today, a video has emerged of the occupiers brutally killing a warrior who bravely said to their faces: "Glory to Ukraine!".
I want us all to respond to his words together, in unity: "Glory to the Hero! Glory to the Heroes! Glory to Ukraine!"
And we will find the murderers.
I thank everyone who is now fighting for Ukraine! I thank everyone who helps Ukraine!
Eternal memory and honor to all those who gave lives for freedom for our people!
Eternal memory and honor to all Ukrainian heroes of different times who dreamed and fought for freedom for Ukraine!
Ukraine will emerge victorious!
